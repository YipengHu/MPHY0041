## 1. Python
This repository contains coding tutorials, exercise and examples in the module, based on Python. This is outside of the module scope, but one might find useful materials and links in the [UCL Module MPHY0030 Programming Foundations for Medical Image Analysis](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/WEISSTeaching/mphy0030), including: 
- [Supported development environment for Python](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/WEISSTeaching/mphy0030/-/blob/master/docs/dev_env_python.md)
- [Work with Git](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/WEISSTeaching/mphy0030/-/blob/master/docs/dev_env_git.md)
- [A Roadmap to Learning Python and Machine Learning by Yourself](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/WEISSTeaching/mphy0030/-/blob/master/docs/diy_python_ml.md)

# MPHY0041: Machine Learning in Medical Imaging
[UCL Module](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/machine-learning-in-medical-imaging-MPHY0041) | [MPBE](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/) | [UCL Moodle Page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk)
>Term 1

This repository is for the deep learning part of the module.

## 1. Development environments
This repository contains coding tutorials and exercises based on Python. While assuming basic experience in Python programming, learning materials are summarised in the [docs](docs) folder. 

- The supported development environment tools are summarised in module [development environment](docs/env.md).
- For a refresher, have a look at [A Roadmap to Learning Python and Machine Learning by Yourself](docs/python_ml.md).
- Module tutorials are implemented in both [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 
    - [Learning TensorFlow for Medical Imaging](docs/tensorflow.md).
    - [Learning PyTorch for Medical Imaging](docs/pytorch.md).

## 2. Deep learning tutorials
Deep learning tutorials are in Python scripts, in the [tutorials](./tutorials) folder. 
Individual tutorials may also require other libraries which will be specified in the readme.md in individual tutorial folders (see links below).
- Image classification: [Anatomical structure classification on 2D ultrasound images](tutorials/classification/readme.md)
- Image segmentation: [Segmentation of organs on 3D MR images](tutorials/segmentation/readme.md)
- Image registration: [Unsupervised registration of CT image slices](tutorials/registration/readme.md)
- Image synthesis: [Ultrasound image simulation](tutorials/synthesis/readme.md)

## 3. Formative assessment
A list of tasks are detailed in the [Formative Assessment](docs/formative.md). Complete them for individual tutorials.

## 4. Reading list
A collection of books and research papers, relevant to deep learning for medical image analysis, is provided in the [Reading List](docs/reading.md).

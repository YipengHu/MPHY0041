## 1. Python
This repository contains coding tutorials and exercises based on Python. While assuming basic experience in Python programming, some learning materials are aummarised in the [docs](docs) folder.

- [A Roadmap to Learning Python and Machine Learning by Yourself](docs/python_ml.md).
- _Optional_: Some basics use of Git is summarised in [Work with Git](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/YipengHu/mphy0030/-/blob/main/docs/dev_env_git.md)

For technical support with coding environment, please read the [Supported development environment for Python](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/YipengHu/mphy0030/-/blob/main/docs/dev_env_python.md).


## 2. Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter notebooks are archived in the [notebooks] folder. [Get started with the Jupyter notebook](notebooks/readme.md).


## 3. Deep learning tutorials
Deep learning tutorials are in Python scripts, in the [tutorials](tutorials) folder.
[Get started with the deep learning tutorials](tutorials/readme.md).


## 4. Reading list
A collection of books and research papers, relevant to deep learning for medical image analysis, is provided in the [Reading List](docs/reading.md).

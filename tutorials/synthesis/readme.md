# Synthesis

This totualrial demonstrates an algorithm of ultrasound image simulation using generative adversarial networks (GANs), using a data set described in [a published research paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.05392.pdf). The [deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) is implemented in TensorFlow and PyTorch.

The following animates the randomly sampled simulations from 1st to 75th ephoch.

The local folder [legacy](./legacy) contains an implementation of [the original spatially-conditioned GANs](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.05392.pdf) in TensorFlow 1.
